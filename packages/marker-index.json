  "readme": "# marker-index\n\nThis module is used by Atom to efficiently track logical locations in a text buffer as the contents of the buffer are changed.\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nimport MarkerIndex from 'marker-index'\n\nlet index = new MarkerIndex\n\n// associate a marker id with two ordered start and end points\nindex.insert(1, {row: 2, column: 5}, {row: 4, column: 10})\n// splice represents a change to the text file\n// you pass it a starting point, then points representing the old and new extent\nindex.splice({row: 3, column: 5}, {row: 0, column: 0}, {row: 1, column: 0})\n// the marker's end point was updated by the splice\nindex.getEnd(1) // => {row: 5, column: 10}\n```\n\n## `MarkerIndex` API\n\n### `insert (id, start, end)`\n\nAssociates the given non-negative integer with a range represented by two `{row: number, column: number}` objects.\n\n### `splice (start, oldExtent, newExtent)`\n\nUpdate the locations of all markers based on the description of a change to the text. The range of the replaced text is described by *traversing* from `start` by `oldExtent`. The range of the new text is described by *traversing* from `start` to `newExtent`.\n\n*Traversal* means that beginning with the `start` location, we arrive at a new location by performing X line feeds and carriage returns and then walk forward Y columns, where X is the `row` of the given traversal extent and Y is its `column`. So basically `start`, `oldExtent`, and `newExtent` describe two ranges in the file, basically the spatial before and after effects of a change.\n\nThis method returns an object that describes what markers were *invalidated* by the change based on various invalidation strategies. If a marker is in a set for a given strategy, it was invalidated according to that strategy. The strategies are as follows:\n\n* `touch` Contains markers that the change touched in any way.\n* `inside` Contains markers that the change touched, but not markers with endpoints immediately adjacent to the change.\n* `overlap` Contains markers that had one or both of their endpoints surrounded by the change.\n* `surround` Contains markers that had both endpoints surrounded by the change.\n\n### `setExclusive (markerId, boolean)`\n\nThis method allows to control the behavior of a marker when splices start and/or end at the marker's endpoints.\n\nBy default, we consider markers to be *inclusive*: that is, splices exactly at the beginning of the marked range will be considered to begin inside the marker (meaning that the marker's start position **will not** move), and splices exactly at the end of the marked range will be considered to end inside the marker (meaning that the marker's end position **will** move). \n\n*Exclusive* markers, on the other hand, exhibit a slightly different behavior: in fact, splices exactly at the beginning of the marked range will be considered to begin outside the marker (meaning that the marker's start position **will** move), and splices exactly at the end of the marked range will be considered to end outside the marker (meaning that the marker's end position **will not** move).\n\nPlease note that, independently of whether a marker is inclusive or exclusive, its end **will always** be moved when its start gets moved as a result of a splice.\n\n### `isExclusive (markerId)`\n\nReturns whether the given marker id has been set to behave exclusively via `setExclusive`.\n\n### `delete (markerId)`\n\nRemoves the specified marker from the index.\n\n### `getRange (markerId)`\n\nReturns the range for the given marker id, in the form of an object with `start` and `end` points.\n\n### `getStart (markerId)`\n\nReturns a `{row: number, column: number}` object representing the start of the specified marker.\n\n### `getEnd (markerId)`\n\nReturns a `{row: number, column: number}` object representing the end of the specified marker.\n\n### `dump ()`\n\nReturns the current location of every marker in the index, represented as an object mapping marker ids to range objects. For example:\n\n```js\n{\n  '1': {start: {row: 2, column: 5}, end: {row: 5, column: 10}},\n  '2': {start: {row: 4, column: 10}, end: {row: 6, column: 3}}\n}\n```\n\n### `findIntersecting (start, end = start)`\n\nReturns a set with the ids of all markers intersecting the specified point range.\n\n### `findContaining (start, end = start)`\n\nReturns a set with the ids of all markers intersecting the specified point range.\n\n### `findContainedIn (start, end)`\n\nReturns a set with the ids of all markers contained in the specified point range.\n\n### `findStartingIn (start, end)`\n\nReturns a set with the ids of all markers starting in the specified point range.\n\n### `findEndingIn (start, end)`\n\nReturns a set with the ids of all markers ending in the specified point range.\n\n### `findStartingAt (position)`\n\nReturns a set with the ids of all markers starting at the specified point.\n\n### `findEndingAt (position)`\n\nReturns a set with the ids of all markers ending at the specified point.\n"
